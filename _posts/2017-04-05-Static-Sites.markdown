Headed into today with the plan of at least beginning a personal static page, something that I was really excited about.

Checking out One Page Love, and all of the incredible sites there was inspiring and I immediately jumped into the apparently maddening rabbit hole of SVG animation. I’m still unclear on how this actually works inside the browser, but what it actually does is draw the different lines of a picture, let’s say “Hello World”. It would start at the H, and draw its way all the way across the object, something that we’ve all seen before, but in practice it can be clean and very impressive. Especially if it ins’t obvious, just a small touch of class. That turned out to be an all day affair, but it has been educational.

SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics, and that’s what it does, it draws the different vectors. Not sure how HTML5 actually supports it, but I’m pretty sure that it gets rendered inside of a canvas element on the page.

They can also do really cool things with it, like draw the outlines of a picture, phone, computer, whatever and when the drawing completes, the real image fills in. Also things like the text filling up with water. Things that really feel buttoned up and over the top professional.

I’ve been working with Jekyll today as well, Github’s static site program. Which is nice, but is maddening in the way it functions, or maybe that’s just the Jekyll template I’ve been using. Lots and lots of hidden parts. Annoying. But at the end of the day I had a nice little custom icon that draws itself across the screen, on a super clean minimal website. Which looks beautiful, and still needs to filled out with pertinent information. Ha. I try to see the meaning behind all of these undirected days, what you do when you aren't getting paid kind of thing, you know. While front end design is awesome, and really fun, I don't think it has the depth to keep me interested, but I don’t we’ll see.
