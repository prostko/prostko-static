Notes on [this article] on the psychology of success.

Fixed and Growth Mindset.

I first encountered the edges of this theory in the wild inside a climbing gym in Charlottesville, VA. A tiny hobbyist gym roughly the same size as a largish bathroom, except 3 stories tall. The walls are speckled with florescent colored holds that are muted by the heavy dust of white climbers chalk and it smells like a junior high locker room. ( It has since gotten much nicer, which I'm ambivalent about. )

At first I hated it.

Those big holds you see on playgrounds and at spring fairs? Those aren't the holds at climbing gyms. Here your more likely to reach for something that extends a quarter of your fingernail from the wall, and the only way to traverse this thing is to deftly shift your center of gravity underneath the hold by sliding your hips across the grey wall. It's hard. It's humbling. It isn't something you are naturally good at. I fell. I cheese-grated down the wall. I failed. I flailed and landed squarely back first onto the mats. A lot.

But the thing was, if you thought about it hard enough, if you paid attention to the right things, you realized something. That every single time you went to the gym, you get slightly better. Even if it was just getting your fingers one inch closer to the next position, that was one inch. And as soon as I realized that, I became addicted. It really was every time you went you get slightly better, so I just went every day. Then the real challenge started. Which is hitting a plateau athletically and the only way to get past it is to think about how you're going about the problem.

Which is so strange. This exact process I kind of fell into is what this research has been about all along. Changing a mindset to better yourself.

And so this reflective kind of state translates itself to every other part of your life. To me it seems like it is the secret to life itself. It embodies all of the parts of what I want to be. Motivated, happy, productive, a better friend, a better husband. It all boils down to letting go of the past, concentrating on the moment with a plan for the future, and changing failure into something that you almost want. Maybe not want. But expect to happen, at least.

This all makes me really excited to be alive. It kind of makes everything attainable and invigorating.

This is a great website to check out if you like practical, actionable psychology as much as I do. BrainPickings
