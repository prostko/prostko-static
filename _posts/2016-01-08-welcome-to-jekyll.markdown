Today I worked on my resume, scrubbing away the traces of my old career off of it.

Only now am I really feeling like I am stepping into an entirely new career. Up until now its been like learning an interesting new hobby or something. Now I’m highlighting my highlights, my past accomplishments, and they wink away to the gentle click of the delete key. Those things don't matter anymore, at least not to the people who occupy this new future. I’m happy. But it’s just a last, long, tightened look at the past.

Anyways, enough of that!

During lunch we sat in for a talk about Jekyll, a lightweight language developed by Github best suited for making simple, static sites. It uses a language called Liquid that was developed by Shopify to integrate partial and layouts. It’s really exciting because its so light, it almost barely exists. Its like the only part that has any true weight is the front end design, which is strange and exciting. It allows you to focus almost solely on the presentation, like [this website][yakub]. So simple, but just enough.

The talk was also really inspiring because of a bunch of inspiring site, one of which was called OnePageLove which is full of the coolest single page websites you can think of. They are all full of that almost magical balance we used to chase in the kitchen between technical skill just this side of completely hidden, yet still manage to brush that part that makes you raise your eyebrows and mutter ‘Woah’ under your breath. Now all I want to do is create a super artsy personal page and fill it with all of my projects and
accomplishments and things. Still gotta work on those, though.

Check out this link to a really cool site focusing on single page websites (like this one). [One Page Love][onePageLove] (Also be sure to hit the 'launch website' button to see the real thing)
